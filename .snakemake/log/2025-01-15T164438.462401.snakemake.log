Error in rule perform_pca:
    jobid: 1
    input: test.gds, pop.csv
    output: Rplots.pdf
    shell:
        
        Rscript -e 'source("perform_pca_snp.r"); perform_pca("test.gds", "pop.csv")'
        
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job perform_pca since they might be corrupted:
Rplots.pdf
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
